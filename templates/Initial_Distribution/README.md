A collection of simulations exploring the optimal initial beam distribution.

| `Grid-like` |  example of generating a grid-like distribution in `normalised x` vs `delta` |
| `Near_resonance` | example of generating the grid-like distribution very close to resonance (with resonance sextupole OFF) |
| `No_losses` | example of generating the grid-like distribution aiming in zero losses (before slow extraction begins) |
| `Resonance_sextupol_ON` | example of generating the grid-like distribution with the resonance sextupole ON (exploring the resonance cut) |
