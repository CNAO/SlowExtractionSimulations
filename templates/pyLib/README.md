## Present Examples

| *file* | *description* |
| --- | --- |
| `Steinbach` | calculating stable areas for different tunes and plotting the Steinbach diagram with `steinbach.py`|
| `Initial_delta` | plotting phase space for a beam with non-zero initial momentum offset with `phase_space_characterization.py`|
| `Hardt_condition` | exploring the chromaticity effect on the Hardt condition |
| `Functions_Tutorial` | explore the transverse phase space using `optics.py` |
